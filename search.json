    "text": "hirst wood nature reserve, saltaire\n\n\ni fear i’ve become boring. my life has settled down into a broadly recognisable shape, displaced by only eight miles and made more solitary. in many ways i’ve “made the best” of the situation - i get out for walks along the canal and in nature, i cook nice meals, i see friends. my work is going well. my work is the only thing that’s stayed the same. my new home is “lovely”, it’s comfortable, i enjoy being here.\nsomething is missing, though. quite a few things, really, but all have congealed into one heavy Thing. i go a full week without spending time with anybody, both by choice and not. my newfound journalling habit is hamstrung by how little of interest i have to document at least half the time. the walls are bare. when the working day ends, i miss the purpose. walking around saltaire i feel overcome with dread about my future’s shape. possibly for the first time in my life, i have no clear idea of what i’m aiming for.\nin some important ways, my current situation aligns with what i’d expected life to look like now - the hills, the canal, the convenient rail links and budget supermarkets. in more important ones, it’s nothing like that at all. in all honesty, admitting to still being in pain over the breakup after maybe appearing to be “taking it well” is almost shameful.\nmy whole attitude to romantic relationships has been dominated by various shames for as long as i’ve pursued them - being ashamed of being gay, trans, autistic, asexual, and now boring. openly expressing feeling anything much at all has felt agonising - i worry still that some of my family and closest friends have no idea how much i love them, because i still find it unspeakable. at odds with everything i believe about intimacy, i feel obligated to keep all details of my romantic life (such that it was) between me and, sometimes, my partner. knowing full well that a relationship being entirely uncomplicated by conflict is an often dangerous fiction, i still limited any expression of my concerns to just one person, or nobody, until the relationship was irreversibly failing. this isn’t to say things could’ve been different if i’d been more open with loved ones outside that relationship, but to instead contextualise why “confessing” any of my feelings about this after the fact feels so torturously difficult.\nso, in truth, half a year after the breakup i feel as though i’ve been hollowed out. my former partner didn’t “complete” me, i don’t believe a single relationship does that for anybody, but he represented a stability and a future that are both now lost. the stability of my longest ever relationship, a remarkably easy one to be in until the final two months. few people in my life knew that he broke it off days after we first agreed to be a couple - i felt then, and i still feel now, that i understood why he did and that, if we tried again, the relationship could work. and it did.\ntending to that relationship, moving in together and settling into a stable living arrangement gave a basic structure to my imagined future. the timing of the breakup meant both this imagined future and the present reality of my life were both upended. this is the essential heavy Thing from which all the smaller sub-things emerged. making the best of this situation has left me in a comfortable, successful but fundamentally unwanted position. my old home isn’t far away. in fact, i’m visiting it again the day after i’m writing this. i don’t think i ever appreciated it enough.\nfor the entire time i lived in leeds post-graduation, up until the two months between the breakup and me leaving, i had the imagined future as my goal. the present reality felt temporary, was temporary in my mind. in a sense this is perfectly reasonable for me to have felt - the plan from before i moved back to leeds was always for my former partner and i to move in together after he graduated, and i had no reason until shortly before the breakup to expect that this wouldn’t happen. i did also make it clear that i was sad to no longer live with my housemate of two years and friend of many more. did he, too, see it as temporary, my plans aside? if my former partner wasn’t a factor, would we have tried to keep living together indefinitely? when i mentioned us living together again as an impossibility on a late night phone call, they said we could talk about it at some point if it was something i wanted. instead of asking whether it was something they wanted, i just cried silently and let the moment slip away.\nultimately, then, i feel unable to consider changing my situation in any real way for many of the same reasons i find it remarkable i’m considering making this piece available for anybody to read at all. this doesn’t quite explain why i fear i’ve become boring, though. the twin massive upheavals of the breakup and unexpected, abrupt move to a town where i know nobody and feel largely out of place have also led me to settle into a smaller existence. much of the time i feel as though i hardly exist outside my job. i’m grateful that it’s stayed the same, that i enjoy it so much, that i’m appreciated there. it’s hardly enough, though. when i try to write at the monthly group i’ve been attending most months this year, all that comes to mind is the breakup. most days after work, i feel no desire to do anything. when i go on one of my nice walks, i find myself tearing up at nothing at all. some weeks i barely eat meals and forget to drink water, become paranoid about leaving the flat. it’s almost as though, without being observed by my former partner, i no longer see the point in keeping up the performance.\na university friend moved to leeds recently, and when we met in saltaire one afternoon i found that i had nothing but work to talk about. when i went on the first and only date i’ve had since the breakup, i found that i had nothing to talk about at all. when i see my friend i lived with until june, conversation is easy, but they’ve long been the person i find easiest to talk to. with other close friends i mostly try to let them talk at me as much as possible, occasionally throwing in an unsolicited factoid about the history of my new town or what baked good i’m planning to make and then probably eat half of in one sitting. i know as i write this that i’m being very ungenerous to myself and will probably read this back on a better day and think i had no sense of perspective at all, but it’d be dishonest to pretend this isn’t what i feel.\nwhat happened in april and june has made me withdraw into myself, shrink away into this quiet flat and throw myself into my work. i write this not out of self-pity or to ask for sympathy but to try and excise this constant gnawing shame i don’t feel able to properly express. i know it’ll take time to move past what happened, inasmuch as that’s a thing you can do, but that isn’t going to happen if i leave it to eat away at me.\n\nthank you for reading this to the end, as i assume you did if you’re reading this. i wrote this in one sitting and didn’t edit it much (as you can probably tell) after walking to hirst wood nature reserve and feeling frustrated that thinking about all of this was taking me outof the moment again. here’s a song i thought about while writing:"

    "text": "a tortoiseshell butterfly at rodley nature reserve\n\n\nWe move as one, burrowing through the veins and arteries of the world’s beating heart. We move shapelessly, scrambling over and around each other, unceasingly pushing toward our destination. Each of us is dressed alike, with earthy brown shawls covering shoulders of varied form and size, and ochre boots strapped to many and few legs. Our differently-seeing eyes are trained forward, some unable to parse the uniform blackness, others detecting the tiniest changes in the rock’s quality, signalling the gentle heat of our target.\nNone of us knows another through any means but our shared pursuit. We’ve crossed borders in space, language, species and time to unite in this greatest aim. Our communication is multimodal, translating light, scent, heat, motion and sound to guide our varied whole forward. My role in this network is to vocalise the precise photothermic signals of my comrades, disseminating a carefully judged approximation of their semantics to those without the attuned senses to interpret them otherwise. Our whole is a cacophony of data, recursively feeding into itself and blossoming beyond recognition. To break away from the mesh of information would be suicide, and all other possibilities were obliterated the moment we split this world’s surface.\nIn our journey, our sublimation to the whole, we are without individual belief or ambition. Contradictory visions of our quarry are held simultaneously - it is a weapon, a deity, the beginning and the end, a wish granter. These beliefs brought us here, but none of our number are still wedded to them. All we truly believe is that we must reach this device. \nAs we burrow further toward the warmth, our surroundings shift and transform. Silt to loam to clay to rock, glistening in a wider array of hues the deeper we burrow. Every two days or so, we carve out a small cave and share food, information, light. Claws and shards of certain rocks let us create fire, fed by scraps of foliage stashed by comrades from forests, swamps and open plains. Preparations crafted by hand or machine are all pooled together, we pass them between ourselves and attempt a kind of conversation. Abstract cave paintings convey stories, and we chirp and glimmer with excitement. Despite holding so little in common, we achieve a kind of kinship and community, information shared for pleasure instead of survival.\nOnce we finish eating, those of us who need to sleep do so, while the rest keep watch. Though this isn’t strictly necessary, given that we haven’t encountered anything but soil and rock throughout this entire journey, most of those keeping watch would have done so back home. The rest, in silence, keep them company. Our sleep has gradually synchronised, an almost preternatural process driven by necessity. In this way, we’ve become a more efficient organism, many bodies sharing a nervous system. When it comes time to progress, our guards wake the rest. Without sunlight, the enforced sleeping time is the only substitute for a circadian rhythm for those of us used to days and nights.\nWe press on, feeling the apparatus’ heat building ever more rapidly, though how much further there is to go remains unclear. Our kin from tundra and and ice caps begin to flag, so our shape folds around them to carry and insulate. Though they can no longer directly contribute to the dig, their communicative role remains vital - without each point in the network, our group would be split in two. Communication and information have overtaken digging as the priority - reaching our goal has become an inevitability, so long as we maintain the web.\n\nFinally, we break through the rock into a great cavern. A colossal column, located exactly in the centre of the cave yet still appearing to be a natural formation, reaches downward. Below it, a roughly-circular plateau sits underneath small bodies. A group of children, glowing with starlight, something like a molecular cloud radiating from their heads in beautiful purples and greens. They’re what we came here for. Together, we carefully climb down from where our tunnel met the wall of the cavern, and approach the plateau. The children turn their heads to look at us, staying sat on the smooth ground. Each of us reaches out to one of them, and they reach back. Upon making contact, their bodies appear to change, becoming more like each of ours, but retaining their otherworldly quality. It’s clear to us why we were brought here, for this singularly crucial purpose. All comes from this place, and the cycle will begin again.\n\nthis, after Southfield and The sculptor, was my second submission for the goldsmiths class. it started life in a panicked freewrite at headingley caffè nero.\nthe photo of the butterfly was taken at rodley nature reserve a few months before i wrote the story."

    "text": "a storm over new york\n\n\nTapping. A wave of violent tapping echoes through the Igapó as dusk spreads its wings over the tapestry of trees above. As we tap the trunks, we scurry towards the understory and into our craft. We all know which entrance we should take into the craft, we all learned as larva what we had to do to survive the night. The craft was a strange, cold thing, impossibly shining as it began to hum and turn in the tangled branches. Once each hatch was closed behind us, the craft sprung out of the canopy and thrust us into the safety above. There was where we would wait until dawn, most of us sleeping soundly as the heavens turned.\nFurther above the craft, a single Moky was sat in a curious structure, kept company only by a single wheel. Her mandibles gripped its handle firmly, the steady movement of her head spinning the stars above. Whatever mechanism demanded the wheel to be turned did so without a sound, and so the silence of the vacuum outside was echoed within the structure. The Sun rolled in a spiral away from the structure, while the Moon mirrored its path throughout the night.\nI’m the servant of the structure. I’ve been entrusted with its mechanisms. My place is at the wheel, alone, holding the skies in balance. In many ways this night was like every other, the heavenly path remaining the same, a familiar lack of company while I turn the handle. But not quite. I’ve kept track. Tonight, the Moon will shine at its brightest over the tundra lake for the tenth and final time this cycle. Three down, two to go. I don’t remember who I was ten phases ago, but that isn’t the point. The point is I’ll be back in the forest in less time than I’ve been up here. I’ll be back with the knowledge of why the wheel is worth turning, why my silent duty matters, and what lies beyond the sky.\nThe meteor showers over the furthest reaches of the tundra showed me where this wheel sits in this quiet world, in the endless skies beyond this one. Other worlds bled through those showers. Last cycle, the showers brought the charred remnants of a war waged by false gods. The cycle before that brought fragments of a shattered space station, split by a falling moon so long ago.\nTonight’s shower will bring something new, a new understanding of what lies beyond the confluence of worlds the forest sits below. Twinkling, twirling, tumbling fires streak across the Moon’s face, some trace of a foreign ritual.\n\ni originally published this to my now-disused medium account on new year’s day, 2020. it’s the only thing i ever published to that account.\ni wrote new year over christmas during my first year at university - i’d found my first term unbearably difficult and spent a lot of time imagining the “quiet world” of this story. over that break i considered switching degrees from linguistics & sociology to zoology, and the Moky were one of a few species ideas i came up with at the time that never made it into any other writing. in the end i dropped sociology instead.\nthe photo was taken the summer before i started university, from a hotel on the lower east side. i didn’t take many photos back then."
